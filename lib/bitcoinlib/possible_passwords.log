This file contains passwords and blocks from passwords which `may` not exactly match those that BTCRecover searches for by default. 

Examples of successfully decrypted blocks will not just be random characters, some examples of what correctly decryped blocks logs look like are:

Possible Password ==>btcr-test-password<== in Decrypted Block ==>{
"guid" : "9bb<==
Possible Password ==>testblockchain<== in Decrypted Block ==>{"address_book":<==
Possible Password ==>btcr-test-password<== in Decrypted Block ==>{"tx_notes":{},"
Possible Password ==>Testing123!<== in Decrypted Block ==>{"double_encrypt<==

Note: The markers ==> and <== are not part of either your password or the decrypted block...

If the password works and was not correctly found, or your wallet detects a false positive, please report the decrypted block data at https://github.com/3rdIteration/btcrecover/issues/
